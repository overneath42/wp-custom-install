# Custom WordPress Install Build

Since I've been working a great deal in WordPress recently, I've identified several plugins which I use frequently. This is a stable 3.4.2 install base for WordPress with these plugins preloaded. Titles and descriptions are listed below.

# Plugins Used:

## Login Lockdown

Limits the number of login attempts from a given IP range within a certain time period.

## Secure WordPress

Secure WordPress beefs up the security of your WordPress installation by removing error information on login pages, adds index.html to plugin directories, hides the WordPress version and much more.

1. Removes error-information on login-page
2. Adds index.php plugin-directory (virtual)
3. Removes the wp-version, except in admin-area
4. Removes Really Simple Discovery
5. Removes Windows Live Writer
6. Removes core update information for non-admins
7. Removes plugin-update information for non-admins
8. Removes theme-update information for non-admins (only WP 2.8 and higher)
9. Hides wp-version in backend-dashboard for non-admins
10. Removes version on URLs from scripts and stylesheets only on frontend
11. Blocks any bad queries that could be harmful to your WordPress website

## Adminimize

Visually compresses the administratrive header so that more admin page content can be initially seen. Also moves 'Dashboard' onto the main administrative menu because having it sit in the tip-top black bar was ticking me off and many other changes in the edit-area. Adminimize is a WordPress plugin that lets you hide 'unnecessary' items from the WordPress administration menu, submenu and even the 'Dashboard', with forwarding to the Manage-page. On top of that, you can also hide post meta controls on the Write page and other areas in the admin-area and Write-page, so as to simplify the editing interface. Compatible with WordPress 2.5 or later. Configure all metaboxes and other areas in the write-area. The new theme move the Tags- and Categorys-box to the sidebar, switch off optional metaboxes and other areas in the write-area. Many options for menu, submenu and all areas, metaboxes in the write-area, separated for all roles in WordPress.
